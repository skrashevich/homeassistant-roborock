# Roborock integration for HomeAsssistant

WARNING: There are reports of temporary bans for using the integration. I'm actively working to get around the [issue](https://github.com/humbertogontijo/homeassistant-roborock/issues/163)

## About this repo
I've bought a Roborock S7 Maxv and hated the fact that I had to use the Roborock App or the previous existing HomeAssistant integration. But not both.

Using the Xiaomi integration there is also a limit to the number of map request which this integration don't have

Hope everyone can enjoy this integration along side the Roborock App
